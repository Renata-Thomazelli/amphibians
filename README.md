# Amphibians' Machine Learning MultiLabel Classification Problem

Unraveling the Multilabel Classification Challenge with Machine Learning

In this project, we delve into a multilabel classification challenge with seven classes. Our goal is to predict the presence of amphibian species near water reservoirs based on features obtained from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and satellite images. You can find the dataset and problem proposal at this link: Source.

The libraries we used in this project include:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- skmultilearn

This problem was particularly challenging, requiring a deep understanding of each variable, its scientific context, and its correlation with the classes. For a more in-depth analysis, check out my Medium article available at this address: Read here.

I’d like to express my gratitude to the Data Science Academy for their guidance and for proposing this project on their blog Ciência e Dados.
